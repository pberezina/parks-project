# Exploring yearly trends in U.S. public park access data

The dataset studied contains 714 ParkScore rankings for various cities across the United States in 2012-2020 [1, 2]. ParkScore is a comprehensive approach to evaluating public park accessibility and comparing different park systems developed by the Trust for Public Land [3]. It includes weighted scores for median park size in each city, accessibility to the residents, investment, and amenities. In 2021, the Trust for Public Land also added a new category score â€“ equity. .Rmd file includes code for data exploration and manipulation using ggplot2, mice, dplyr as core libraries to answer the following questions:
-	What are the descriptive statistics of park access features?
-	Which cities have most top-ranked parks across years?
-	Which factors influence the park rank most?
-	Are there any relationships between factors?
-	How does inclusion of equity score in the ranking in 2021 affect previous ranking trends?
